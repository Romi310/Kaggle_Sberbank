# Kaggle_Sberbank
NYCDSA - Machine Learning Project

In April 2017, Sberbank, Russia’s oldest and largest bank, created a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market) with the goal of predicting realty prices in Russia. Given Russia’s volatile economy, this was a unique challenge. Sberbank provided Kagglers with a rich dataset of over 200 variables, depicting both housing features and macroeconomic information, to address this challenge.
